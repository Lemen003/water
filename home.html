<div class="about"><h2>Our lives depend on clean water.</h2> Cleaning up our rivers,
lakes and streams, and keeping them clean, requires coordinated effort and constant vigilance.
In fact, Americaâ€™s waterways only started to get cleaner when the people who
lived near them began seeing them as places to cherish and protect, not exploit;
and began to come together and act on their behalf. Today those local heroes need all the help they can get.
There are many contributors, big and small, but here we will highlight local
contributors here around Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.</div>
