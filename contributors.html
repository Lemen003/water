Visiting the organizations mentioned on this site will open up a lot of ways where
you can personally help with keeping the water clean. Many of these organizations
take gifts and donations but there are also plenty of opportunities to help with your own hands.
These organizations also hold events that raise money and that money will then go to
their clean up projects. Some organizations even host meet ups at specific sites where
you can actually get hands on experience and help them clean.</div>
